Fenced code blocks
You can create fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks ``` before and after the code block. We recommend placing a blank line before and after code blocks to make the raw formatting easier to read.

```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```

Tip: To preserve your formatting within a list, make sure to indent non-fenced code blocks by eight spaces.

To display triple backticks in a fenced code block, wrap them inside quadruple backticks.
